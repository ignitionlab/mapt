Create an Analysis Checklist
  Why? 
  - Helps to create a minimum baseline for security testing
  - Provides consistency across tests
  - Allow for consultant to have some leeway to get creative during the application testing process.

Implementing the Analysis Checklist
  Why ? - Creates a repeatable process which can be used to drive consistency and metrics
  Areas in which this can help
  - 

Four areas of Analysis: Typically we look at two of these four areas, however all should be covered to ensure complete coverage. 
  1 - Mobile Forensics & Data Recovery
  2 - Network, web services and API testing
  3 - Server-side penetration testing
  4 - Reverse Engineering & Code Analysis
  
1 - Mobile Forensics & Data Recovery
Mobile Data at Rest: Locations on a mobile phone where data-at-rest can be found:
- Private Application Folder - Folder is created everytime you install an app and use it - True for IOS and Android
- SD Card / Emulated SD Card - Specific to Android
- System log files - Applies to all platforms, not just specific to mobile apps, but also for the devices itself. eg, Error logs  
  Used during development phase to help with debugging, often get forgotten about when app goes into production.  
- Keychain - Used to store usernames and credentials - IOS only.
- RAM - Often data will reside here until a device is rebooted
- Source code (Hardcoded) - Values hardcoded into app, passwords and values - code analysis required to check for these.
- Web Cache / history - hybrid/web wrapper apps - Not so common these days.

Target:               Relevant Tools & or documentation
File System           Android: debug bridge - adb commands, ie - abd pull command
                      IOS    : libimobiledevice

System Log Files      Android: logcat - command line tool
                      IOS    : Syslog

IOS Keychain          IOS Keychain 

RAM                   Android: debug bridge - adb commands, ie, - adb dumpsys meminfo
                      IOS    : heapdump-ios
                      
Understanding & Prioritising findings by risk:
 - Risk depends on the location of data: - Data stored on SD card is considered higher risk than data stored in the application folder      as other applications will also have access to the SD card.
 
 - Considerations for risk:
   - Sensitivity of the data
   - Likeliness of exploit 
   - Remote vs local attack (physical access required).
   - CVSS can be used as there is a mobile focus 
  
Pointers to consider when performing analysis: 
SQLite Databases, plist(IOS) and xml files - find a favourite viewer for sifting through these formats
Look for data stored as common hashes/encodings - base64, md5, sha256
Use command line grep in large files for data
Look beyond usual storage locations - Dont limit yourself.
IOS apps use the Cache.db file which often contains a large amount of data - Default from IOS 6/7 >

2/3 - Network, web services and API testing

Data in Transit: Typical issues include:

- Insecure Communication
  - Certificate validation issues  - Lack of certificate validation, developers accept using a self-signed certs.
    Tools - mitmproxy - If certificate validation in implemented correctly, no traffic should be shown in mitmproxy tool.
  - Privacy leakage
    - Sharing of sensitive data by Android Apps to domains 
      - Email Addresses
      - Username/Password
      - Phone number
      - IMEI/IMSI
      - Home Address
      - Content of messages

- Insecure authentication (Process of sending credentials in an attempt to connect)
  - Predictable session identifiers
  - Failing to log users out
  - Session lifetime risks
    - Sessions valid too long
    - Sessions valid across multiple channels
  - Session Fixation
  
- Insecure authorisation (Gain access to a resource based upon the configured permissions allowing your access)
  - Servers accepting/responding to request without authorisation
  - Client based authorisation decisions
  - Simple errors found in requests and reponses : such as isAdmin false changed to isAdmin true

Server Side security - Typically same common issues that occur in web applications, see OWASP top ten.
  - Injection
     - SQL
     - XSS
     - Command
  - Improper session handling - Session still valid for period of time even after sign out.
  - Weak Ciphers - As per web application testing using tools such as ssltest. 
  
Try using both trusted and untrusted certificates when intercepting data in transit.

4 - Reverse Engineering & Code Analysis

Reverse Engineering(RE)- taking the executable code(not human readable) and translating it into something that easier to understand.  It also involves disassembling code into it component parts.  

The purpose of RE:
  - Analysis of the Apps Code
  - Identifying vulnerabilities
  - Finding hardcoded sensitive data
  - Analysis of malware
  - Modifying an app functionality
  
Why RE:
Can the app be tampered with?
Can the app be modifiied during runtime?

Does the app allow you to pull it from the device, re-sign it and then re-install?
  - Can the app's main executable be modified?
  - Can the app's supplementary files such as scripts and native libraries be modified?

What can be seen as a result of hooking API's?
  - Filesystem
  - Cryptography - dump keys, initialisation vectors, identifying cipher, dump the decrypted blob
  - Network - what servers and IP addresses does the app talk to
  - Observe the app as it writes files or transmits data- is any interesting/private data being leaked?
  
Specific vulns that should be identified by RE:
  - Insecure network communication / sensitive data leaking over the network - Typically occurs with API hooking 
  - Interprocess communication (IPC) issues
    - More relevant to Android apps as IOS apps typically dont talk to one another
    - Content providers with directory traversal or SQLi vulns
  - Hard Coded Encryption keys
  - AES with null initialisation vector (IV)
  - Helpful logging is disabled at runtime
    - But logging statements still available during static analysis
    - Can be used to determine names for classes and variables
    - Common in Java
  - Logic Flaws or easily circumvented security
 

Example: Android
adb shell pm list packages ~~ This returns a full list of packages, locate the one we require: com.appscentral.psa
adb shell pm list packages -f com.appscentral.psa ~~ This returns the location of the apk file on the device : package:/data/app/com.appscentral.psa-2/base.apk=com.appscentral.psa 
adb pull /data/app/com.appscentral.psa-2/base.apk  ~~ This pulls down the apk file for the app
apktool d base.apk

Use dex2jar to convert classes.dex file into a readable format for JD-GUI so thta you can search through source code for strings like passwords or API's.

Command in Kali is: d2j-dex2jar -h


Use apktool to get smali code
