Create an Analysis Checklist
  Why? 
  - Helps to create a minimum baseline for security testing
  - Provides consistency across tests
  - Allow for consultant to have some leeway to get creative during the application testing process.

Implementing the Analysis Checklist
  Why ? - Creates a repeatable process which can be used to drive consistency and metrics
  Areas in which this can help
  - 

Four areas of Analysis:
  1 - Mobile Forensics & Data Recovery
  2 - Network, web services and API testing
  3 - Server-side penetration testing
  4 - Reverse Engineering & Code Analysis
  

1 - Mobile Forensics & Data Recovery
Mobile Data at Rest: Locations on a mobile phone where data-at-rest can be found:
- Private Application Folder - Folder is created everytime you install an app and use it - True for IOS and Android
- SD Card / Emulated SD Card - Specific to Android
- System log files - Applies to all platforms, not just specific to mobile apps, but also for the devices itself. eg, Error logs  
  Used during development phase to help with debugging, often get forgotten about when app goes into production.  
- Keychain - Used to store usernames and credentials - IOS only.
- RAM - Often data will reside here until a device is rebooted
- Source code (Hardcoded) - Values hardcoded into app, passwords and values - code analysis required to check for these.
- Web Cache / history - hybrid/web wrapper apps - Not so common these days.

Target:               Relevant Tools & or documentation
File System           Android: debug bridge - adb commands, ie - abd pull command
                      IOS    : libimobiledevice

System Log Files      Android: logcat - command line tool
                      IOS    : Syslog

IOS Keychain          IOS Keychain 

RAM                   Android: debug bridge - adb commands, ie, - adb dumpsys meminfo
                      IOS    : heapdump-ios
                      
Understanding & Prioritising findings by risk:
 - Risk depends on the location of data: - Data stored on SD card is considered higher risk than data stored in the application folder      as other applications will also have access to the SD card.
 
 - Considerations for risk:
   - Sensitivity of the data
   - Likeliness of exploit 
   - Remote vs local attack (physical access required).
   - CVSS can be used as there is a mobile focus 
  
Pointers to consider when performing analysis: 
SQLite Databases, plist(IOS) and xml files - find a favourite viewer for sifting through these formats
Look for data stored as common hashes/encodings - base64, md5, sha256
Use command line grep in large files for data
Look beyond usual storage locations - Dont limit yourself.
IOS apps use the Cache.db file which often contains a large amount of data - Default from IOS 6/7 >

2 - Network, web services and API testing
